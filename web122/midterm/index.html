    <h2>The Slumber Pill</h2>
    <p>There once was a town much like this one. It had roughly one hundred thousand people. It was a college town which
        meant there were plenty of festivities to excite a regular citizen or passerby. Really the only difference
        between
        our town and this one was that this town had been built around a sleeping dragon.
        The name of the town was the dragon’s name. The dragon’s name was Raascow.</p>

    <p>Stories had been told that he was there since a hundred years ago when the town was founded. He was helpful in
        clearing the forest and eating the wild pests and deer. One very long cold winter the dragon became very sick
        and
        the city decided to do something about it. So they hired a medical team to make the world’s largest pill
        imaginable
        and tricked the dragon into eating it.</p>

    <p>Raascow fell asleep and had been sleeping ever since. They tried to wake him up… they tried pulling him with
        large
        machines.. pricking him with pointy objects, but to no avail! Nothing could disturb his deep slumber. His scales
        were too thick to break, his body too heavy and large to move. It soon became evident that the city (which was
        growing enormously due to tourist attraction to the large sleeping dragon) would have to build itself around
        Raascow
        for there to be any industrial growth. Raascow was claimed - after years of immovable silence… - a historical
        landmark
        and declared untouchable.
        Students from all around the globe who attended the Raascow Kansas University gawked and choked at the sight of
        a
        dragon sleeping in the midst of the city. But the regular citizens didn’t pay any mind.</p>
    <h3> Years passed.</h3>

    <h2>The Booming City</h2>
    <p>Raascow was a wealthy place… it had it’s own news station with a special group monitoring the dragon’s every move
        (or the lack of it). The temperature around the dragon was always five or so degrees more than the outskirts of
        the
        city. Tall buildings loomed across the sky. There were more streets, more bridges, cars, people, apartments,
        banks,
        restaurants, stores, an amphitheater, a zoo, trains, subways, Els, alleyways, bums, thugs, rugs… you name it!
        And
        all managed to live over around and under the dragon without ever being disturbed. The slumbering dragon never
        moved
        anyway.</p>

    <p>The dragon’s tail however… stretched far past the city along the wavy meadows of the countryside… and hadn’t
        moved
        an inch. Because the dragon’s tail was so warm… it was in times past a popular rural hangout in the winter. But
        as
        Raascow transformed into a booming metropolis a fair ground was built over part of the dragon’s tail.
        Toward the edge of the tail only a few miles from the fairground… there was a farm that belonged to the Meklim
        family. On this farm they had a beautiful white and red trimmed house, and acres and acres of land. The Meklims
        were
        a young family with six kids. Mr. Meklim had inherited the land from his father. He and his wife had two
        daughters
        and three sons… the youngest was just a baby.</p>

             <!--Left aligned image or svg of farm house?-->
    <h2>The Meklims</h2>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Meklim didn’t like the closeness of the fair ground… or the dragon’s tail lying on their plot of
        land
        for that matter…. But because it was considered a historical landmark they made the most of it and converted the
        tail (conveniently settled in a little dip in the ground and made of some sort of water resistant material)…
        into a
        beautiful fish pond and garden!
        The Meklims had a way of solving problems and getting around things in their way. The father was an engineer and
        the
        mother was a surveyor… but of course whenever they weren’t at work they preferred to spend their time with
        family on
        the farm.</p>

    <p>One of the families greatest pastimes on Sunday evenings was game night where they would all get together and
        play
        games, work on their 5,000 piece puzzle, play cards.
        It would seem that they had been there for years but really they had just moved in five months ago and were
        settling
        in fine. One of the little girls was having a birthday party. The sky was cloudy but it was not wet and the
        weather
        was good for barbeque and celebration. A couple families came over and the adults were talking and cooking and
        the
        children were playing.</p>

    <p>It was on this particular day that a miracle happened. All of the family and friends went inside so the girl
        could
        open her presents and blow out the candles. All except the eight year old boy who was still outside and trying
        to
        climb the big Silver Oak Tree as high as he possibly could. He had made pretty good head way and was a good
        fifteen
        feet from the ground.</p>

    <p>“Where’s Miles?” asked Mrs. Meklim.
        “I’ll find him!” Said Serese who was ten at the time. She ran outside to find her brother soaking wet in the
        fish
        pond.
        “Miles what are you doing!?”
        Miles just stared at her, in shock.
        Mrs. Meklim, embarrassed, scolded Miles and sent him downstairs to clean up and get dressed in some dry clothes.
        After that she demanded to know why he had been swimming in the fishpond.
        “I wasn’t!”
        “Then what were you doing? Did you fall?”
        “I climbed the oak tree and the branch snapped and I fell.”
        “Miles Meklim! The fish pond is all the way across the yard from the tree how could you have fallen in?”
        “The pond reached out and caught me.” Miles used his hand and arm to illustrate what he meant.
        Miles had indeed told the truth about the tree branch… which lay on the ground… all twenty feet of it. But there
        was
        not a sign of a bruise or scratch on Miles… and the pond was exactly where it had been before… except that it
        looked
        as if someone had torn away all the bushes and flowers growing around it’s edge.
        The Meklims didn’t know exactly what to think. If Miles had fallen he was very fortunate not to have been hurt…
        for
        he had climbed very high… and beneath the tree he could have easily hit a good five foot pile of bricks or Mr.
        Meklim’s wood supply both located under the tree.
        Whatever the case… we’ll have to leave the Meklims for now and continue this story another time… but the
        Meklims,
        especially Miles, never forgot about that strange, strange event on Levia’s fourteenth birthday.
        “Papa do you think that the dragon is ever going to wake up?” asked Serese.
        “I don’t know.”</p>

    <h2>NOTE TO ILLUSTRATOR:</h2>
    <p>I apologize I didn’t come up with a title so if you think of one that would be great!
        This story is being told by a narrator but you don’t have to have everything that the narrator says written
        down… so
        long as you keep the feeling going that this is a story being told by someone.
        Time period: imagine the city is Lawrence. The time frames are Lawrence now (roughly one hundred thousand
        people),
        Lawrence one hundred years ago when it was founded and was a small town and mostly country, Lawrence years from
        now
        if it was a booming metropolis.
        If you feel the need to add scenes or characters not in the story in order to enhance the story please do. I
        would
        love to see what you come up with.
        Also you may change the words the characters say slightly to fit the story better, or add small bits of dialogue
        if
        you wish in other scenes where there isn’t any just to make the story more interesting.
        I can’t wait to see what you come up with! ^_^</p>
