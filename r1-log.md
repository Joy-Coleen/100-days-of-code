### R1D1 
Followed Dani Krossing's tutorial: How to Create a Toggle Menu | Part 1 | HTML & CSS Setup | JavaScript Menu | JavaScript Tutorial. Forked (copy and paste someone elses code) this repo, and created a reset style sheet (gets rid of default style settings, and allows you to start from scratch).

### R1D2
Yesterday I forgot to enter a log, but I picked up a school final project which is to make an eccomerce website w/ JavaScript and HTML + CSS. I worked on making the remove button functional in the shopping cart section.

### R1D3 Today I worked on the shipping selection in the shopping cart section of the eccomerce website.
