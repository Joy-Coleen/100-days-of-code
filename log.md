<!--# 100 Days Of Code - Log-->


# Day 3: Jan 13, Wed

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website I talked about in my 1st two Rounds; I might switch to writing logs like this instead. I worked on the shipping section

**Thoughts** Because this personal project was picked up from a semester ago i'm relearning lots of things. Currently with the shipping section I am not sure if the logic will work, or if I am correctly writing the if/else blocks of code, but well see I guess. With there being an hour I have to code, it takes the stress off of doing things right the 1st time, as my goal is no longer to finish this or that in a day, but to code for an hour. It's achievable and the last few days i've felt like a winner. *Aside from not having entered this log for the 1st 2 days and not pulling code to github till yesterday that is... That's a failure on my part, but also a learning curve.

# Day 4: Jan 14, Thurs

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website. I worked on the shipping section trying to connect shipping costs to the total amount and submit button. The only visible difference is now the submit button, and shipping list isn't showing.

**Thoughts** Today felt less productive, and more discouraging than the others as I didn't move forward in my code at all. Just spent a long time trying to figure out how to do things. I guess now I know what not to do, but that's it.

# Day 5: Jan 15, Fri
**Today's Progress**: I learned about the following: 
append() A method that inserts content at the end of selected elements.
Command c = comment out highlighted text
I worked on my Eccomerce website. I got the shipping section to show again -earlier I had closed curly brackets prematurely- as there were some things that should have been in curly brackets. I added the onchange method. It still is not functional. I also researched github as i'm struggling with using it.

**Thoughts** Today started off not good, but near the last 20 min, I got more focused and took more in. Using github is a learning curve.

# Day 6: Jan 16, Sat
**Today's Progress**: I made progress on the shipping section as the specified option value will pop up with selectElement.textcontent. This link was helpful https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-selected-value-in-dropdown-list-using-javascript/#:~:text=Method%201%3A%20Using%20the%20value,then%20nothing%20will%20be%20returned. to learn about option values; how they work.
**Thoughts** Today is Sunday, as I didnt start 'till 12:00am. It was hard to get started, but i'm glad I did, as it wasn't that hard once I did. I feel like I progressed, and I have an idea to make the product price + shipping value pop up. The last 6 min of coding I was pretty done though. gnight... Gmorning I mean.

# Day 7: Jan 17, Sun
**Today's Progress**:  I watched tutorials about Object Oriented Programming. Nathan Foreman reccomended I learn and implement that to my eccommerce website, so today I didn't code. Just unatentavely watched tutorials-no note taking. I did find this site, and I think i'll go through their page step-by-step homework tommarrow: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

**Thoughts** I felt kind of lazy, half attentively watching vids about OOP in bed.

# Day 8: Jan 18, Mon
**Today's Progress**: I followed the guide over Objects https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics Learned about names and values in objects and how you can make properties and methods inside objects. Also how to find, or make properties and objects inside JavaScript Console.

**Thoughts** It was informative. I like Mozzillas guide on this so far.

# Day 9: Jan 19, Tues
**Today's Progress**: I followed the guide over Objects https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics Learned about .this, replacing object name for convenience, how objects and the Document Object Model function the same. Eg.) document.createELement, the .createElement is accessing a method for the document.
**Thoughts** It was informative. I like Mozzillas guide on this so far. I will continue going through mozillas guides on objects.

# Day 10: Jan 20, Wed
**Today's Progress**:  I made a bare bones portfolio, for my class tommarrow. I followed Dani Krossings tutorial: 12: How to Create Links in HTML | Basics of CSS | Learn HTML and CSS | HTML Tutorial 
**Thoughts** I am pleased with the turn out. It was fun to do, as it was easier for me than expected. It's made me realize that I have improved. I think I won't drop that class after all but stick to my guns.

# Day 11: Jan 21, Thurs
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my Shopping Cart project. Specifically aesthetics with adding images, and changing styles in CSS.
**Thoughts**  The portfolio and this was kind of for school, so bending the rules there, but working on the aesthetics was satifsying for the shopping cart, as I like the outcome.

# Day 12

# Day 13 Jan 23, Sat
**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on setting up a web host -cSpan
**Thoughts** I wasn't succesful. It's through the school, so I need to email the professor and ask for help as my student account info didn't work.

# Day 14 Jan 25 Mon
**Today's Progress**: Today I did some research into the web 290 class i'm taking and finally figured out (with assistance of vs code) how to do that problem 2 with Mozilla lesson on objects.
**Thoughts** Worried about web 290 class, more than accomplishing anything.

# Day 15 Jan 26 Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Today I FINALLY was able to git fetch, pull, git add --all, git commit, and git push a folder inside the #100DaysOfCode Repo. Quite an accomplishment for me. I also am reading Mozillas guide on Objects and Constructor functions where you create one function with names, and you can create others, that will use the 1st functions names, while implementing its own values.
**Thoughts** Today was a good day. I started at 4:00pm instead of the usual, 9 or 10pm. I have a start time every day for 3:15 p.m. now.

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on oop with Mozilla again. I added if else statements and a for loop to code
**Thoughts**

# Day 17 jan 28 Thurs
**Today's Progress**: Learned about Object prototypes sortof which are like methods that you can put in a seperate function and yet use as part of object, by denoting it by object name.
**Thoughts** experiencing coding burnout here.

# Day 18 jan 29 Fri
**Today's Progress**: I learned about inheritance with Objects and their constructors.
**Thoughts** Will have to review how prototypes and inheritance works-last 2 articles. Studying for an hour was not too difficult today- I was in the zone. Also, using the terminal and doing every day tasks has become easy for me.

# Day 19 Jan 30 Sat
**Today's Progress**: Studied Mozillas guide on Objects, where I left off, for 5 seconds and then worked on my shopping cart page.
**Thoughts** It was hard because I didn't have a plan of action, but also encouraging, because I understood the code better and was able to fix some things. I think tommarrow my hour will largely be spent working on the site again while referencing the Textbook I used for JavaScript 2. That my plan of action.
