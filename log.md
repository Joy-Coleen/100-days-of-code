<!--# 100 Days Of Code - Log-->


# Day 3: Jan 13, Wed

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website I talked about in my 1st two Rounds; I might switch to writing logs like this instead. I worked on the shipping section

**Thoughts** Because this personal project was picked up from a semester ago i'm relearning lots of things. Currently with the shipping section I am not sure if the logic will work, or if I am correctly writing the if/else blocks of code, but well see I guess. With there being an hour I have to code, it takes the stress off of doing things right the 1st time, as my goal is no longer to finish this or that in a day, but to code for an hour. It's achievable and the last few days i've felt like a winner. *Aside from not having entered this log for the 1st 2 days and not pulling code to github till yesterday that is... That's a failure on my part, but also a learning curve.

# Day 4: Jan 14, Thurs

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website. I worked on the shipping section trying to connect shipping costs to the total amount and submit button. The only visible difference is now the submit button, and shipping list isn't showing.

**Thoughts** Today felt less productive, and more discouraging than the others as I didn't move forward in my code at all. Just spent a long time trying to figure out how to do things. I guess now I know what not to do, but that's it.

# Day 5: Jan 15, Fri
**Today's Progress**: I learned about the following: 
append() A method that inserts content at the end of selected elements.
Command c = comment out highlighted text
I worked on my Eccomerce website. I got the shipping section to show again -earlier I had closed curly brackets prematurely- as there were some things that should have been in curly brackets. I added the onchange method. It still is not functional. I also researched github as i'm struggling with using it.

**Thoughts** Today started off not good, but near the last 20 min, I got more focused and took more in. Using github is a learning curve.

# Day 6: Jan 16, Sat
**Today's Progress**: I made progress on the shipping section as the specified option value will pop up with selectElement.textcontent. This link was helpful https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-selected-value-in-dropdown-list-using-javascript/#:~:text=Method%201%3A%20Using%20the%20value,then%20nothing%20will%20be%20returned. to learn about option values; how they work.
**Thoughts** Today is Sunday, as I didnt start 'till 12:00am. It was hard to get started, but i'm glad I did, as it wasn't that hard once I did. I feel like I progressed, and I have an idea to make the product price + shipping value pop up. The last 6 min of coding I was pretty done though. gnight... Gmorning I mean.

# Day 7: Jan 17, Sun
**Today's Progress**:  I watched tutorials about Object Oriented Programming. Nathan Foreman reccomended I learn and implement that to my eccommerce website, so today I didn't code. Just unatentavely watched tutorials-no note taking. I did find this site, and I think i'll go through their page step-by-step homework tommarrow: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

**Thoughts** I felt kind of lazy, half attentively watching vids about OOP in bed.

# Day 8: Jan 18, Mon
**Today's Progress**: I followed the guide over Objects https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics Learned about names and values in objects and how you can make properties and methods inside objects. Also how to find, or make properties and objects inside JavaScript Console.

**Thoughts** It was informative. I like Mozzillas guide on this so far.
