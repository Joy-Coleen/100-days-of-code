<!--# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!--**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!--### Day 1: Jan 27, Monday 

<!--**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

<!--**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# Day 3: Jan 13, Wed

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website I talked about in my 1st two Rounds; I might switch to writing logs like this instead. I worked on the shipping section

**Thoughts** Because this personal project was picked up from a semester ago i'm relearning lots of things. Currently with the shipping section I am not sure if the logic will work, or if I am correctly writing the if/else blocks of code, but well see I guess. With there being an hour I have to code, it takes the stress off of doing things right the 1st time, as my goal is no longer to finish this or that in a day, but to code for an hour. It's achievable and the last few days i've felt like a winner. *Aside from not having entered this log for the 1st 2 days and not pulling code to github till yesterday that is... That's a failure on my part, but also a learning curve.
