##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

<!--**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

<!--**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

<!--**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

# Day 3: Jan 13, Wed

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website I talked about in my 1st two Rounds; I might switch to writing logs like this instead. I worked on the shipping section

**Thoughts** Because this personal project was picked up from a semester ago i'm relearning lots of things. Currently with the shipping section I am not sure if the logic will work, or if I am correctly writing the if/else blocks of code, but well see I guess. With there being an hour I have to code, it takes the stress off of doing things right the 1st time, as my goal is no longer to finish this or that in a day, but to code for an hour. It's achievable and the last few days i've felt like a winner. *Aside from not having entered this log for the 1st 2 days and not pulling code to github till yesterday that is... That's a failure on my part, but also a learning curve.

# Day 4: Jan 14, Thurs

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on the eccomerce website. I worked on the shipping section trying to connect shipping costs to the total amount and submit button. The only visible difference is now the submit button, and shipping list isn't showing.

**Thoughts** Today felt less productive, and more discouraging than the others as I didn't move forward in my code at all. Just spent a long time trying to figure out how to do things. I guess now I know what not to do, but that's it.

# Day 5: Jan 15, Fri
**Today's Progress**: I learned about the following: 
append() A method that inserts content at the end of selected elements.
Command c = comment out highlighted text
I worked on my Eccomerce website. I got the shipping section to show again -earlier I had closed curly brackets prematurely- as there were some things that should have been in curly brackets. I added the onchange method. It still is not functional. I also researched github as i'm struggling with using it.

**Thoughts** Today started off not good, but near the last 20 min, I got more focused and took more in. Using github is a learning curve.
