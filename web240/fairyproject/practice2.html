      <h2>Time moves so fast</h2>
      <h2>
        In just a matter of weeks and months children change so quickly, so
        having portraits done RIGHT NOW is important.
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can think to yourself, I'll take care of it soon, but before you
        know it 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, have gone by and we have missed
        capturing that stage of their childhood.
      </p>
      <p>Take your children's portraits as they are right now!</p>
      <h2>A GREAT BONUS!!</h2>
      <p>You get to chose whichever image we create that is your favorite.</p>
      <p>You receive this whether you order any extra copies or not.</p>
      <p>
        After 40 years we have developed cute games which not only relax your
        child but create the perfect expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        One trick is that I will often place a quarter on my forehead and have
        them blow it off. When it comes off we get looks of wonderment, and
        smiles. This is just one trick of over 50 along with expressions that I
        use. Experience comes in when you know what trick or expression to use
        with each child's unique personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        A perfect portrait of your child is a treasure forever. Capture this
        unique magical moment in time.
