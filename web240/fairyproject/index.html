<h2>Dear Mom and Dad:</h2>
      <p>
          Children grow up very fast! The best way to
        preserve these youthful moments in time is with professional portraits.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been blessed to capture precious memories of children for over
        forty years. Time moves so quickly and childhood is so fleeting that
        it's gone before we know it!!
      </p>
      <p>
        When you reach our ages you really appreciate pictures that have frozen
        moments in time for you. Nothing can do this like professional
        portraits! Childhood portraits of your children are the only way those
        times of wonder and excitement can be remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
        When parents come and view their pictures after they are taken in our
        "Magical Fairy Forest" with the beautiful fairy dresses and wings we
        provide for them, Moms often cry. What a wonderful experience for Mom
        and us to capture innocence, magic and beauty of their childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great pride and planning go into creating a "fairy portrait experience"
        that your child will always remember. With special forest backgrounds,
        rocks and a mystical pond that the little girls can put their toes in
        creates an experience of magic, wonder and awe for your Little Fairy
        Princess. Boys like to play Robin Hood and go fishing. The added special
        effects that our artists create will take your breath away. Remember we
        allow a full thirty minutes or longer to work with each child.
      </p></section>

      <p>
        From the time you enter the studio and see our Mystical Forest, along
        with our custom created fairy dresses and wings, the outside world is
        left behind. All little girls (and some Moms too) want to be fairy
        princesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nina and I, by the way, my name is Steve, have been doing portraits of
        babies, children and families for over 40 years. It's the best job
        anyone could ever have. We get to watch eyes light up when parents see
        their portraits and this gives us a warm feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our sets are custom built and we are very proud of our special custom
        created, one-of-a-kind, designer dresses and wings for your little girl.
        These are created exclusively by the most renowned fairy dress designer
        in the country. Along with the custom built forest props, custom
        dresses, our artists add amazing special effects to enhance the fairy
        mood and scene.

      <h2>
        These will be the finest portraits of your child that you have ever had
        taken!!
      </h2>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that like in all jobs experience is very important. We have
        photographed over 100,000 sittings in our 40 year career. We feel this
        gives us the knowledge and the ability to read the feelings of our
        little friends that lets us capture that precious image at just the
        right moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty of this is that you will be the final judge of the portraits
        and we have full confidence that we cannot only please you but have you
        amazed at the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take plenty of time, and schedule accordingly, so that each child
        gets all of the time and attention she needs to have a wonderful
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>When you leave the session you will be excited to see the results.</p>

      <h2>Time moves so fast</h2>
      <h2>
        In just a matter of weeks and months children change so quickly, so
        having portraits done RIGHT NOW is important.
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can think to yourself, I'll take care of it soon, but before you
        know it 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, have gone by and we have missed
        capturing that stage of their childhood.
      </p>
      <p>Take your children's portraits as they are right now!</p>
      <h2>A GREAT BONUS!!</h2>
      <p>You get to chose whichever image we create that is your favorite.</p>
      <p>You receive this whether you order any extra copies or not.</p>
      <p>
        After 40 years we have developed cute games which not only relax your
        child but create the perfect expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        One trick is that I will often place a quarter on my forehead and have
        them blow it off. When it comes off we get looks of wonderment, and
        smiles. This is just one trick of over 50 along with expressions that I
        use. Experience comes in when you know what trick or expression to use
        with each child's unique personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        A perfect portrait of your child is a treasure forever. Capture this
        unique magical moment in time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hold on to these precious memories and avoid having to say, "I wish I
        had had her picture taken when she was..." (so and so age)
