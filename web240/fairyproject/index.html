        <aside> Children grow up very fast! The best way to preserve these youthful
          moments in time is with professional portraits.
        </aside>
        <p>
          We have been blessed to capture precious memories of children for over
          forty years. Time moves so quickly and childhood is so fleeting that
          it's gone before we know it!!
        </p>
      <p>  When you reach our ages you really appreciate pictures that have frozen
        moments in time for you. Nothing can do this like professional
        portraits! Childhood portraits of your children are the only way those
        times of wonder and excitement can be remembered.</p>

          When parents come and view their pictures after they are taken in our
          "Magical Fairy Forest" with the beautiful fairy dresses and wings we
          provide for them, Moms often cry. What a wonderful experience for Mom
          and us to capture innocence, magic and beauty of their childhood.

              Great pride and planning go into creating a "fairy portrait experience"
              that your child will always remember. With special forest backgrounds,
              rocks and a mystical pond that the little girls can put their toes in
              creates an experience of magic, wonder and awe for your Little Fairy
              Princess. Boys like to play Robin Hood and go fishing. The added special
              effects that our artists create will take your breath away. Remember we
              allow a full thirty minutes or longer to work with each child.

          From the time you enter the studio and see our Mystical Forest, along
          with our custom created fairy dresses and wings, the outside world is
          left behind. All little girls (and some Moms too) want to be fairy
          princesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nina and I, by the way, my name is Steve, have been doing portraits of
          babies, children and families for over 40 years. It's the best job
          anyone could ever have. We get to watch eyes light up when parents see
          their portraits and this gives us a warm feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our sets are custom built and we are very proud of our special custom
          created, one-of-a-kind, designer dresses and wings for your little girl.
          These are created exclusively by the most renowned fairy dress designer
          in the country. Along with the custom built forest props, custom
          dresses, our artists add amazing special effects to enhance the fairy
          mood and scene.

          These will be the finest portraits of your child that you have ever had

        </h2>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that like in all jobs experience is very important. We have
          photographed over 100,000 sittings in our 40 year career. We feel this
          gives us the knowledge and the ability to read the feelings of our
          little friends that lets us capture that precious image at just the
          right moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of this is that you will be the final judge of the portraits
          and we have full confidence that we cannot only please you but have you
          amazed at the results.

          In just a matter of weeks and months children change so quickly, so
          having portraits done RIGHT NOW is important.
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can think to yourself, I'll take care of it soon, but before you
          know it 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, have gone by and we have missed
          capturing that stage of their childhood.
        </p>
        <p>Take your children's portraits as they are right now!</p>
        <h2>A GREAT BONUS!!</h2>
        <p>You get to chose whichever image we create that is your favorite.</p>
        <p>You receive this whether you order any extra copies or not.</p>
        <p>
          After 40 years we have developed cute games which not only relax your
          child but create the perfect expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One trick is that I will often place a quarter on my forehead and have
          them blow it off. When it comes off we get looks of wonderment, and
          smiles. This is just one trick of over 50 along with expressions that I
          use.</p>
        <p><aside> Experience comes in when you know what trick or expression to use
          with each child's unique personality.
